**Serverless Devs VSCode Plugin**It was born to facilitate the use of the serverless architecture. Through the form of VSCode plugin, users can better experience [Serverless Devs](https://github.com/Serverless-Devs/Serverless-Devs) in the form of GUI+CLI, which is still in the development and internal testing stage, but most of the functions are already available. We will continue to improve it to bring a better serverless experience to developers.

## Get started quickly

1. Install Node.js(>=12.0.0) and NPM tool;

2. Find our app in VSCode (we recommend searching for your full name: **Serverless-devs**);

3. Typically, you need to get the [credential](https://docs.serverless-devs.com/serverless-devs/default_provider_config/readme) first;

4. Select how you want to create and create the app;

5. Develop programs in a new project window and edit configurations, deploy, build, and more

   > Some features rely on [Serverless Devs](https://github.com/Serverless-Devs/Serverless-Devs), but the plugin detects and provides an installation process. The plug-in shares a local configuration file with [Serverless Devs](https://github.com/Serverless-Devs/Serverless-Devs).
